Live at [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a59b66da-4d0b-4aac-b4c5-877c17b123d0/deploy-status)](https://matteo-color-picker.netlify.app)

It's a simple palette picker where you can:

- shuffle over colors
- lock a color if you like it and then you can modify or shuffle the others
- change colors with sliders (saturation and brightness too)
- Save a palette that you like in localStorage
- Loads saved palettes from local storage (even if you close the browser)
